## Description

Well Done is a simple food timer app that takes the thinking out of cooking steak, chicken, fish and eggs! Each protein has their own methods of cooking and
cook times will vary depending on your preferred choice of doneness. The timer utilizes a pulsing animation built with CABasicAnimation and buttons are animated with CGAffineTransform.
If the application is on the foreground, it will play an alarm using the AVFoundation framework. If the application is moved to the background, you will receive a push notification when the timer is complete. 

#### Frameworks

- UIKit
- AVFoundation
- UserNotifications
- Core Animation
- Core Graphics
